### Brain stroke is a life-threatening medical disorder caused by the inadequate blood supply to the brain.
### After the stroke, the damaged area of the brain will not operate normally. As a result, early detection is crucial for more effective therapy.
### Given a patient's medical and personal history, deep learning methods can be used to predict with high accuracy whether the patient will have a stroke.\
